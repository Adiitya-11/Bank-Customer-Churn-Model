# Bank-Customer-Churn-Model
A Bank Customer Churn Model is a predictive analytics project aimed at identifying customers who are likely to leave or "churn" from a bank's services.

The project typically involves gathering and analyzing historical data on customer demographics, transactional behavior, account activity, and other relevant variables. Machine learning algorithms are then applied to this data to build a predictive model that can forecast which customers are at risk of churning in the future.

The goal of such a model is to enable the bank to proactively target at-risk customers with retention strategies, such as personalized offers, improved customer service, or loyalty programs, to reduce churn rates and retain valuable customers.
